# movie_recommender

This repository contains four python files that are used to create
a movie recommendation program based on a genre selected by user input.
After determining the desired genre, it returns movie titles, their director(s),
and the intial release year. Upon returning an answer to the first query, it 
will loop as long as the user requests for another genre based movie recommendation.
